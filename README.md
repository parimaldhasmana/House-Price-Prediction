# House-Price-Prediction

**Introduction**

Buying a home is a tricky choice. What are the things that a potential home buyer considers before purchasing a house? The location, the size of the property, vicinity to offices, schools, parks, restaurants, hospitals or the stereotypical white picket fence? What about the most important factor - the price?

**Purpose**
Our aim is to develop a practical model to predict prices from which we can construct a price index that would summarize the housing market.

**About Dataset**

The data set while exhaustive contains, whooping 80 independent variables all of which in someway or the other contributed to the Sale Price of the House 
The Dataset consist of both character and integer variables. Most of the character variables are actually (ordinal) factors, but we chose to read them into R as character strings as most of them require cleaning and/or feature engineering
